= Graphics and Machine Learning Special Interest Group

The Graphics and Machine Learning Special Interest Group (SIG) develops
the strategy, does gap analysis and prioritizes tasks for enabling
RISC-V implementers to support and develop accelerators for Computer graphics and
machine learning.

The group is the result of having recently (December 2021) fused the
Graphics and Machine Learing efforts for synergically developing our
common agenda items.

Our approved
https://github.com/riscv-admin/graphics/blob/main/CHARTER.md[charter]
gives a more precise definition of our purpose within RISC-V.

= Meeting Presentations

The Presentation in this SIG are held in Google Drive in this folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QirnwYmwh1izxg52gWaQ9fK8JAZhg7rU 

= Meeting minutes

The minutes and other materials we use during our meetings are collected
in this repo, under the
https://github.com/riscv-admin/graphics/tree/main/minutes[minutes]
folder.

= Collaboration

We are a mixture of volunteers and member companies trying to bring
RISC-V to new domains. The group welcomes collaboration, with the solely
condition that you join the RISC-V Foundation under the (really
reasonable) terms and conditions in the
https://riscv.org/membership/[membership] section from the RISC-V
Foundation website.

If you have any doubts you can email the group organizers for additional
information:

* Iakovos Stamoulis <i.stamoulis@think-silicon.com>, Chair
* Abel Bernabeu <abel.bernabeu@esperantotech.com>, vice-Chair
