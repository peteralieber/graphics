== Introductions

New faces, notably we got representation from the RISC-V toolchain group
(Christoph Müllner).

== Machine learning follow up

We go through the charter and identify at least one item that relates to
ongoing activities within RISC-V: BFloat16 support.

== ML survey results

The ML survey results are commented. The main take away message: -
Inference in embedded devices (on the edge) seems to be our sweep spot
of interest. - The preferred framework seems to be TensorFlow Lite,
followed by PyTorch/Glow and TVM. No interest in TLX yet.

== Gap analysis for ML: a practical approach

I explain what a valid approach for the gap analysis could be: picking
the practical task of improving the efficiency (instruction count) for a
workload on RISC-V. A ResNet50 implementation is possibly a good
starting point.

Christoph Müllner suggests to try something more general like looking at
industry standard benchmarks rather than cherry-picking models. I think
we will follow up the discussion on next meeting.
