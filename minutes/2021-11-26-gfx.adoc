== Agenda

* Follow up on ongoing tasks (DONE)

``Beyond the RISC-V ISA'' track (DONE)

== Announcement

I announce internally that the Graphics and the ML SIGs are merging. The
decision is settled (the Software HC has enough capacity for deciding
this and has done so). The logistics we will figure out, for example the
ML mailing list may get redirected to sig-graphics if that is supported
by groups.io. This change could be temporary until we split again when
enough critical mass is reached.

The change will affect our agendas, with the merged group prioritizing
the tasks where there is ``sinergy'' between Graphics and ML.

== Follow up ongoing tasks

Atif confirms he is working on collecting the data he needs for doing a
write up of the ``Motivation'' introductory section in the gap analysis
document.

== Slides for the RISC-V Summit

As promised, we go through the slides I have prepared for the RISC-V
Summit. The content of the presentation is closely related to the gap
analysis document.

Constructive feedback is given.

Regarding atomics or memory ordering (barriers), Oguz asks how compliant
RVV is with SPIR-V’s atomics. My answer is that since these details are
not strictly needed for OpenGL ES 2.0 they are being overlooked for us
to focus on other stuff.

Regarding the transcendental functions required for graphics (sin, cos,
exp2 and log2), Oguz asks what is the needed accuracy. I propose we
stick to the accuracy achieved by the scalar implementation, which
should be more than enough for graphics. After the meeting I double
check this suggestion of mine and I see no scalar implementation on
RISC-V (sorry for this).

A good reference for the needed accuracy is the OpenCL spec
(https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/2.2/pdf/OpenCL_Env.pdf):

* For sin and cos the error should be smaller or equal than 4 ULP.
* For exp2 and log2 it should be smaller or equal than 3 ULP.

Oguz suggests that maybe supporting work-item scopes also affects
masking, used for simulating branching, in the sense that we no longer
mask indiviual vector elements but work-items instead. That is correct.

== Discussion on supporing work-item scopes

Regarding the support for work-item scopes I propose people read the
Zvediv extension that was dropped from RVV in the last minute:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/ediv.adoc

Everyone gets yet additional homework: think about how would you add
dimensionality to the vector operand within a work-item scope.
