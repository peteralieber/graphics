== Mesa library support

I summarized what I think is the best course of action for supporting a
RISC-V based shading core on Mesa.

There is currently no easy way to produce LLVM IR from Mesa for feeding
the pre-existing RISC-V LLVM backend. As a matter of fact the Mesa developers
are not keen to support that kind of translation path, when they have made a
massive investment on developing their own intermediate representation:
NIR (New Intermediate Representation).

When I asked about the possibility of using SPIR-V rather than NIR, the
mesa developers did not think SPIR-V gave them any advantage either, quite
the contrary, they felt NIR is giving them functionality that SPIR-V would not.

It is expected from mesa backends that they implement a NIR backend producing
assembly for the target, and that is how we should proceed when starting up
the RISC-V effort. This point of view was shared by mesa developers like
Jason Ekstrand and Connor Abbott (the NIR creator):

https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2022-January/225640.html

Once it is clear that we aim at a community developed NIR backend for mesa,
the answer to the question of what graphics API and version can we aim at
is that we are only limited by two things:

- The supported texture formats, that we select to match the needs of
  OpenGL ES 2.0 but would not be enough for Vulkan.

- The conformance test suite pass rates.

When OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance is achieved we can create new specs including
the needed missing formats (like compressed formats) that are required by Vulkan.
Until then it does not make sense to invest effort in supporting texture
compression.

Either way the NIR backend will be useful for any APIs we want to support in
the future, like Vulkan, just needing to incrementally build on top of the OpenGL
ES 2.0 effort.
  
In addition to the NIR backend we need a software rasterizer that delegates
the shader executions on Spike for building an mesa-based environment where
one can run graphics applications and collect the data. This tool will aid us
on the task of justifying the utility of our extensions for graphics. Note that
this is not the same as using mesa's llvmpipe, and what we are building is
closer to a graphics accelator simulator.


The simulator will produce a report containing the executed shaders ordered
by number of retired instructions, and for each shader we are interested in:
- Number of retired instructions.
- A shader code disassembly

At the end of the report we will also produce a summary with the total number
of retired instructions.

Christoph Müllner asked whether we will need any kind of display code for
presenting the images rendered by our simulator on a screen. Actually, we
can just render on a memory buffer allocated with malloc or new, using
an existing mesa build option for pure offscreen rendering. A console
application potentially running on a docker image is enough for producing
offscreen images and saving them to disk.

== Programming models vs. algorithms

When someone asks for the SIG to explain the most important algorithms for
graphics he is asking the wrong question.

Graphics is about a well defined programming model: the graphics pipeline.

Modern graphics algorithms alternate pipeline state changes and primitive rendering. For example:

- Clear depth and color
- Pipeline update: enable z-buffer test and write, disable color writing, set a dummy fragment shader
- Draw something
- Update the pipeline.
- Draw something.

Algorithms assume this programming model, which is what a graphics core delivers. Benchmarks using
this programming model and not algorithms, are important. And the importance of benchmarks is
ephemeral, like a seasonal fashion. One day Taichi was super important and a couple of years
later we were caring about Manhatan.

== Benchmarking effort

Talking about benchmarks, we can focus on glmark2, which is open source for OpenGL ES 2.0 and we
can hack easily if needed for using our mesa-based simulator.

== Quick update on the matrix multiply TG creation

I asked people to review the draft for the call for the matrix multiply task group creation.
Thanks to everyone who did like Ken Dockser.

Also asked people to write me a one-line email if they were interested in
the matrix multiply TG creation. Thanks to those who did, as it is important
to see what is the actual interest when evaluating whether it is worth putting
RISC-V resources in this basket.
