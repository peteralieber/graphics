== Summary

=== Gap analysis

The gap between RISC-V V and SPIR-V is summarized (slide 8).

Now, is it worth adding everything that is missing?

Some areas like texturing can be justified with a bit of common sense,
but for evaluating other potential additions a proper quantitative
approach is needed.

We discuss that in order to provide that quantitative approach for
guiding the extension work we need tools. Those tools do not exist and
need to be developed:

[arabic]
. A simulator based on RVV.
. A compiler for translating shaders into a (potentially extended) RVV
ISA.

With those two tools we could run benchmarks, but without them we can
not provide any numbers.

Some of the work developing those tools can be shared with Khronos,
hopefully.

=== Tasks for attendees

Mark Himelstein (RISC-V’s CTO): - Do introductions with Khronos for
starting a discussion on how to share tooling efforts.

Atif Zafar (vice-chair): - Contact some of the Mesa developers through
some of Atif’s referrals network for asking for advice about backend
development.

Abel Bernabeu (chair): - Look at Mesa software backends to evaluate how
suitable it is to use them as foundation for our simulator.

Peter Lieber (compiler engineer): - Research the landscape of shader
compilers we can reuse.
