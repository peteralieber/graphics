== Summary

We had a quick chat for discussing the structure the ``Gap analysis''
document has.

Oguz (Mehmet Oguz Derin) suggested to consider the needs of WGSL (WebGPU
Shading Language), and offered some resources for us to learn more about
the project:

* https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb
* https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl

In principle, I think it is similar to WebGL in the sense that it builds
an extra layer of software on top of vendor drivers that follow existing
Khronos standards and accept SPIR-V. The project seems a good
initiative, possibly a candidate for replacing WebGL. We will follow up
to see if there is any work required but at the moment I do not see much
for the group to do in this area.

=== Ongoing tasks

The following people got work assigned:

* Atif Zafar: get figures for our market research, possibly through
colleagues at Jon Peddie Research.
* Peter Lieber: play with a SPIR-V to LLVM translation test, to get a
grasp of the amount of work that is needed in making the Khronos
translator work for GLSL.
* Abel Bernabeu: Keep working on the gap analysis document.
