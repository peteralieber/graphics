= Meeting on 16th September 2021

* Time: 19:00 (Barcelona time)
* Attendees: 7
* Recorded: yes, on the chair’s computer

== Agenda

* Avoiding the ``unified'' concept (DONE)
* New preliminary charter discussion (DONE)
* Vision (DONE)
* A plan for catching up with the industry (DONE)
* Gap analysis tasks (ONGOING)
* Is Skia alive and interesting? (NOT STARTED)

== Summary

=== More introductions

New faces: - Mick Thomas Lim: employed by Intel but attending as
individual contributor. - Peter Lieber: employed by Broadcom but also
attending as individual contributor. - Drew Fustini: Linux kernel
developer.

=== The word ``unified'' gets forbidden

There is no need for our discussions to be centered on a specific kind
of implementation like a unified shading architecture.

That concept is not only not needed but: - It has legal implications
that the chair refuses to discuss (in line with the RISC-V policy that
patenting related matters are not discussed on the RISC-V venues). -
Iakovos mentions there is also a good reason for not centering the
discussion on unified shading architectures. That reason is to allow
innovation by not being too prescriptive.

=== The charter tweaks

* There was an explicit mention of open source, when we are open to
software with any license that makes sense for our members.
* There was a mention of the Graphics SIG representing RISC-V
International towards external organizations, but that is possibly not
something we should aim at. Representing the RISC-V community is one
thing, but we can not represent the RISC-V International legal entity.

Both issues were corrected and fixed in GitHub.

=== Vision

We go through a revisited version of the ``vision'' slides from previous
meeting without a mention of the ``unified'' word.

The suggested roadmap has three stages:

* Single core: defining enough instructions for implementing graphics on
a microcontroller, supporting only vertex and fragment shaders.
* Basic multicore: support for more than one core (shader scheduling).
* Complete multicore: more than one core and addition of all the missing
shading stages (tessellation, geometry shaders and so on).

=== Tasks for attendees

Abel (chair): - Setup voting for our charter a Google form. - Setup
another form for collecting what are our areas of interest (for example
2D graphics with Skia seem to be something mentioned on the mailing
list). - Ask Mark Himelstein (RISC-V’s CTO) whether an FPGA
implementation of an extension is enough or actual silicon is required.
